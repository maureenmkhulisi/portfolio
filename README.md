Analyzing Production Trends and Popular Genres
### Dataset Overview
The Netflix show dataset used in this project contains comprehensive information about movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform. It includes details such as title, type (movie or TV show), country of production, release year, and genre.
### Methods and Analysis
1. Data Preprocessing
The initial phase of the project involved data preprocessing, including cleaning and handling missing values to ensure the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

2. Top Producing Countries
By aggregating and analyzing the data by the country of production, I identified the top countries that were the most prolific in producing movies and TV shows available on Netflix. This allowed me to shed light on the geographic distribution of content creation.

3. Release Year Analysis
Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I determined the years in which Netflix released a higher number of movies and TV shows. This analysis provided insights into trends in content release over time.

4. Popular Genres
Using genre information, I employed data visualization techniques to uncover the most prevalent genres on the Netflix platform. This exploration enabled me to understand the genres that have garnered significant attention from audiences.

5. Results and Insights
Based on the analysis conducted, several key insights emerged:
- The top countries contributing to the Netflix content library were identified, showcasing the global nature of content production.
- Peaks in content release years revealed trends in production cycles and potential shifts in viewer preferences over time.
- The most popular genres on Netflix were unveiled, offering valuable insights into the types of content that resonate with the audience.
